 singularity_chain_quest_desc:0 "Decades ago we transcended our biology and transferred our consciousnesses to immortal, mechanical shells. Now, it is time for us to take the next step; to shed the constraints of physical form, and upload our minds to a gargantuan computer; the Singularity. True immortality will be ours."

 singularity_quest.1003.desc:0 "Now the central processing unit is complete, our eternal consciousnesses are safe. We need only secure the processing unit, and uploads can begin. A thick shell of impermiable neutronium will encase it, as a skull encases the brain."
